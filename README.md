This is a Supervised machine learning model.
I have used juypter notebook and python libraries like numpy, pandas and sklearn to build a simple regression model involving two variables.
Steps inculded:
1. Plotting the given data set.
2. Studying the nature of the data
3. Pre-processing the data: spilitting the data into testing and training variables
4. Training the data
5. Testing the data
6. Calculating accuracy
7. Predicting the results for my own set of data using this model
